# Notes

Copy a file into a parent folder and rename the file at the same time.

`cp old-file-name.txt my-directory/new-file-name.txt`

Move multiple files into a folder (if there is a pattern file1.txt file2.txt..)

`mv file*.txt my-directory`

Remove contents of a directory, but not the directory itself

`rm my-directory/*` or `rm -rfv my-directory/*`
